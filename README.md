# AH-64D Apache TEDAC Project Files

This project contains my personal Fusion 360, Arduino and other files used to build a "close enough" replica TEDAC for the AH-64D Apache.

It is intended to be used with [DCS-BIOS](https://github.com/DCSFlightpanels/dcs-bios) to interface to the [DCS World Apache](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/helicopters/ah-64d/).  The design is to suit my use case, which is something that looks cool and is functional & intuitive in VR. It's not trying to be a perfect replica for non-VR use.

Note that I am not a CAD/CAM professional, and am no longer a professional software developer. No support is provided and there is no guarantee that my files don't suck. To be very clear: I am sharing my personal files so that others can get a headstart. I am not presenting this as a product that I will be supporting or building commercially. Fork it and have fun.

## Compromises

Some compromises have been made as follows:

* The TEDAC faceplate DAY/NT/OFF rotary switch has been replaced with a rotary encoder. I just couldn't find a rotary selector switch small enough to fit.
* The TEDAC LCD used is a smaller 5" 800x480 display as that's what I had on hand. As I'm only using the TEDAC with VR, the LCD is not in use during gameplay so is really only there for cool factor and debug information.  
* The structural mount is designed as a 12mm ply box to fit my cockpit. You will most likely have to design your own structural element to suit your situation. The TEDAC itself is designed into 3 functional parts - faceplate and left/right grips - which can be mounted as you need and can be disconnected individually for maintenance.
