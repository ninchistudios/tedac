# AH-64D Apache TEDAC Project Files

This project contains my personal Fusion 360, Arduino and other files used to build a "close enough" replica TEDAC for the AH-64D Apache. 

It is intended to be used with [DCS-BIOS](https://github.com/DCSFlightpanels/dcs-bios) to interface to the [DCS World Apache](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/helicopters/ah-64d/) in VR.

Note that I am not a CAD/CAM professional, and am no longer a professional software developer. No support is provided, and there is no guarantee that my files don't suck. That said: if they're in this repo, they worked for me.
